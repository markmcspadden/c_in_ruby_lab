About:

Trying basic full text search.

Start with Ruby, and replace pieces with C. (I'm not claiming the Ruby is efficient as written, but it's a place to start.)

Using simple weighting (w=term_frequency*inverse_document_frequency) and ranking (r=w*query_frequency)

If you'd like to read up more on that I find the MySQL internals wiki is a good place to digest: http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/MySQL_Internals_Algorithms#Full-text_Search

Usage:

$ ruby extconf.rb
$ make
$ ruby full_text_search_test.rb
$ ruby benchmark.rb

Attempts:

Attempt #1: Focus on #to_words. Directly use rb_str_split in C to split a string into an array on the spaces
